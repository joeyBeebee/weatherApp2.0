# Weather App with React/Redux

## Overview
WeatherApp2.0 is a an upgraded web app from my previous weather apps that connects users to a weathermap API and google maps API to present a chart of a 7 day period using sparklines library and redux-promise middleware. This app is meant to convey my understanding of containers with redux and basic implementation of API technologies. 

## Technical Specifications
Built with the following technologies: 
* React/ Redux
* WebPack
* redux-promise
* axios
* react-sparklines
* lodash
